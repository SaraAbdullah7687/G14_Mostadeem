Mostadeem is an environmentally friendly application that promotes sustainability. Our targeted users are the institutions who will be accept the recycling request, the contributors who will contribute to sustainable development, and the admin who will manage the institutions accounts and adding the stores and information related to sustainable development. 

The contributor can schedule a request to pick up the recycling items. As the contributors submit additional recycling items, points will be provided to them so they can redeem the points in various stores as an incentive, in addition to advising them on how to live a waste-free life. 
The institutions accept the requests and send a courier to pick up the items from contributor, then based on the submitted items points will be incremented. Mostadeem contributes directly to vision 2030 goals so that not only “The Line” is eco-friendly but rather, the whole Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Mostadeem will help in reducing and managing waste by initiating requests to recycle unused items. 

# Why Mostadeem ? 
   Saudi Arabia has experienced exponential growth in the industrial and agricultural sectors in past decades and significant population expansion and urbanization. Such urban development creates enormous complications on many dimensions, especially in terms of waste management. Waste management, recycling, re-use, energy recovery, and the circular economy are significant aspects of the Kingdom's approach to natural resource conservation, employment development, greenhouse gas reduction from landfills, and waste to energy conversion.
